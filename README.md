# Particle Physics Simulation

## Overview

This project implements a 2D particle physics simulation with basic collision detection, boundary constraints, and interactive mouse forces. The simulation uses OpenGL for rendering and supports creating and manipulating particles with various physical properties.

## Features

- Particle-based physics simulation
- Real-time collision detection
- Boundary constraints
- Interactive mouse force interactions
- Customizable particle properties (position, radius, color)

## Dependencies

- OpenGL
- GLFW
- GLM (OpenGL Mathematics Library)
- C++11 or later
